Send to HGG

You are now ready to send the information to HGG. We advise you to use an FTP server rather than email. Most email firewalls will block unrecognized file formats, also most emails have a data limit of 10 Mb or sometimes 15 Mb per email.

There are several free File Transfer Protocol servers available, HGG recommends WeTransfer:

• E mail to HGG: service@hgg.nl

• Enter your own e-mail address

• Enter your machine number in the ‘Message’ so that it can easily be identified by HGG.

Add your files. Click on the blue cross, browse to your files.
