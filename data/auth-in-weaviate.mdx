title: Authentication in Weaviate (videos)

## Overview

Authentication is one of those topics that we get quite a few questions about. And we can see why. It's a big, complex topic, and even within Weaviate, there are many options available which can make it seem quite confusing.

The core concept of authentication is relatively simple. When a client (e.g. a Weaviate client) sends a request to a server (e.g. a Weaviate database), it includes a "secret" that provides some assurances to Weaviate as to who that request is coming from, so that it can operate on that information.

In other words, the server can provide as much access as the particular user is allowed.

But balancing security with usability can be a tricky line to draw, as everybody has different needs and often use different systems.

So, we thought that this might be a good time to provide an overview of all things authentication in Weaviate. Also, we've recently introduced an API key-based authentication method, which we think might be a good balance of security and usability for many of you. Please check them out below.
